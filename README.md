### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I believe the labs prepared me to complete all the required portions of the assignment. There were someparts of the stretch goals that weren't covered but I think that is fine since they are meant to be challenging. I think covering the basics of the css position property would have been helpful for a basic popup window.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, firstly I would clean up my code since it is not that neat at the moment. I would also add more features, specifically a navigation bar and more details in the movie pop ups. I would also improve the display of the website and pollish it more. Lastly, I would deal with edge cases and fix some bugs. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think the project demo went well. We all took turns show casing our projects and asking each other about our code. There were features I saw that my peers implemented that I liked and also plan to implement, such as hover animations, youtube trailers, and live search results.
